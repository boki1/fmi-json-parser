**Description**

Implement a JSON parser command line application. However I will implement a
JSON parser library and a demo application which uses this library as an
example as this seems way more natural to me :). These are contained in `lib/`
and `app/` respectively. In addition there are some tests in the corresponding
directory. In another addition, I am required to use only a certain part of the
standard library as that is what is the OOP course @fmi is based upon which
means that from time to time I will have to implement a certain type myself.
Check the `mystd/` directory for them.
